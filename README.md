# kinogen

kinogen is a lightweight film cataloguing software utilizing [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

currently it is very unstable, unoptimized, and lacking in inspiration

## features
- simple interface allows you to manage your collection of films relatively easily
- automatically parses files formatted in the [warez scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_(warez)#Naming) standard
- save/ load library scheme

## building
1. clone recursively
2. follow [CURL](https://github.com/curl/curl)'s build instructions utilizing openssl
3. build SDL2, gl3w, etc
- i don't recommend trying to build this right now...
